We want to work with you if you have something exceptional, e.g. skills,
certifications, experience, or maybe price (watch the
[video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_XOaqubwoo)). There are four benefits
for you:

<span class="step">1</span> It’s a **part-time** job and you can work from
anywhere. In most cases we expect you to spend 3-10 hours per week. You can
easily combine our projects with your full-time work.

<span class="step">2</span> It’s **challenging** and **interesting**. You will
solve difficult problems, work with cutting edge technologies, and collaborate
with professionals. No routine or boring tasks.

<span class="step">3</span> You will work with small fixed-scope tasks (usually
30 minutes each), which perfectly fit **your skills** and **experience**. You
may reject any task assigned to you, if you don’t like it, for any reason —
we’ll find more suitable tasks for you.

<span class="step">4</span> We **pay immediately** after the task is completed,
through [Odesk](http://www.odesk.com) or [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com). All
fees are paid by us, you get exactly the budget allocated for the task
multiplied by your hourly rate. Say, your rate is $40/hour and task budget is 30
minutes. You will get $20 immediately after the task is completed.

The [guidelines](/dev/guidelines) explain how exactly you will work.
[Principles](/dev/principles) of team work explain how you should communicate
with the rest of the team.
