We consider code reviews as a much more important activity than code writing
itself. The main and the only result of code review is defects reported.
Checkout the source code from repository, review it, and report defects. There
are a few rules and recommendations:

<span class="step">1</span>  **Don't rush**. At the beginning, some of your
tickets will be rejected, mostly because they are duplicates or incorrectly
formatted. Submit 1-2 tickets per day, until you get used to our process.

<span class="step">2</span> **Anything can be a ticket**.  Don’t hesitate to
make a ticket, if you have a suggestion of how to improve the code, or you don’t
understand how certain class works, or you don’t know what it is for, etc. The
code you have in front of you should be clear and simple. If it’s not, it’s a
defect.

<span class="step">3</span>  **One defect per ticket**. Don’t group problems,
instead, report them separately. This way, it’s easier for us to fix them and
your payout is higher. However, don’t report similar problems in separate
tickets.

<span class="step">4</span>  **Avoid duplicates**. Do keyword search before
submitting a ticket. It is very likely that the problem was already discussed
before.

Keep in mind that we’re paying 1/2hours (30 minutes) for every ticket reported
and accepted. Duplicates and invalid tickets aren’t paid.
