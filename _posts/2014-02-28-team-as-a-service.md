You need to grow by making new software. You need more technical and management
resources. You need many of them and very soon. You can go for head-hunting or
you can try outsourcing. However, if you are savvy enough, there is a better
way:

<span class="step">1</span> We **setup** a web development environment of
proprietary and open source instruments, compliant to XDSD management
principles.

<span class="step">2</span> We **build** and **bootstrap** a distributed team of
programmers, designers, architects, testers, analysts, QA engineers, and a
project manager.

<span class="step">3</span> We **train** your executive team to understand the
management principles of XDSD and effectively control productivity of the
distributed team.

<span class="step">4</span> We **maintain** the team regularly, improving the
software instruments, extending the pool of available engineers, and providing
additional trainings.
