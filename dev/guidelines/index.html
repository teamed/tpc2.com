        <h1>Developer Guidelines</h1>

<p>First of all, we negotiate your hour rate (we rarely bargain) and execute a
contract (review its sample in <a href="http://img.tpc2.com/agreement.pdf">PDF</a>). Send
us your details, including full name, email, address, country, and phone number.
We will send you a signed contract. You will sign, scan, and send it back to us.</p>

<p>Once the contract is signed, you get your project access credentials (Github,
Trac, SVN, etc.) Work starts when the first ticket is assigned to you:</p>

<p><span class="step">1</span> The ticket will have a budget in hours (usually
between 30 minutes and 2 hours). If you don’t agree with the budget, don’t
hesitate to ask for a raise. As soon as you are comfortable with the budget and
you understand the scope of work, say “accepted” in the ticket. Anything you
spend on top of the budget won’t be paid!</p>

<p><span class="step">2</span> Create your own SCM branch and start working. Don’t
forget to sync with master/trunk during your work. Read about <a href="/dev/branches">SVN
branches</a>, <a href="/dev/github">Github branches</a>, and <a href="http://www.xdsd.org/pdd">Puzzle Driven
Development</a>. Everything about the assignment should be
discussed in the ticket (no emails!) When the problem you are solving is bigger
than the budget, you have to leave non-important functionality unimplemented and
mark it with <a href="http://www.xdsd.org/pdd">PDD puzzles</a>.</p>

<p><span class="step">3</span> As soon as you finish, assign the ticket back to
those who assigned it to you, and briefly explain what have you done. Your work
will be reviewed within three days and the ticket will be either closed as
“fixed” or returned to you with comments. If it is returned, go back to the
previous step.</p>

<p><span class="step">4</span> Once the ticket is closed, you will get a payment
from us. Usually it happens within a few hours, but may take a day. The amount
you will receive equals to your hourly rate multiplied by the amount of hours
budgeted for the task. It doesn’t matter how much time you’ve actually spent for
the ticket — you will get a fixed amount, as agreed upon task start.</p>

<p>Once in a while, your hour rate can be increased, after your request and a
negotiation. Usually we increase rates for those who close more and faster.</p>
